        <h2>Drill Rapper BDC_King Faces Backlash After Rival's IG Live Brag</h2>
        <div class="article-meta">
            <p><strong>March 1, 2025 – Station 9 KSENT</strong> | By: Camelia Johnson</p>

        <p>Local drill rapper Zachariah, better known by his stage name BDC_King, is facing a surge of controversy after a viral IG Live video posted by his rival, DTIM_trigga, in which the latter bragged about killing one of Zachariah's members. The video, which quickly spread across social media platforms, saw DTIM_trigga openly boasting about his actions, claiming that he had "caught a body" and killed one of BDC's own. The live stream, which aired just days before the rapper's untimely death, shocked viewers with its raw, unapologetic tone.</p>

        <p>In the video, DTIM_trigga flaunted his supposed victory, taunting Zachariah and his crew with remarks like, "I told y’all it would be me or you," and "He ain't even see it coming." Fans flooded the comment section with messages of support for DTIM_trigga, while others questioned the authenticity of his claims. The streets, however, quickly began to connect the dots, with many speculating that the killing may have been in retaliation for a previous altercation between the two rival groups.</p>

        <p>Following DTIM_trigga's death, rumors swirled that BDC_King, aka Zachariah, may have been the one responsible. Many people started to believe that Zachariah’s crew had taken action against DTIM_trigga in retaliation for his boastful IG Live stream and disrespectful remarks. The timing of the diss track released shortly after DTIM_trigga’s death only fueled the speculation.</p>

        <p>In an exclusive interview with Station 9, Zachariah responded with an unexpected level of composure. "That's unfortunate," he said with a smile. "I mean, DTIM_trigga was a disrespectful n****. He was a very good shooter," Zachariah added sarcastically. "But that's the game, ain't it?" His tone, seemingly nonchalant, hinted at the street mentality that often accompanies the drill rap culture. Zachariah’s comments have done little to quell the rumors, leaving many wondering if he was involved in the killing.</p>

        <p>While Zachariah did not directly confirm or deny his involvement in DTIM_trigga’s death, the streets have spoken. Fans and rival factions alike believe that BDC_King, aka Zach, played a role in the death of DTIM_trigga. The aftermath of the viral IG Live video and Zachariah’s dismissive comments only strengthened the belief that the killing was a retaliation fueled by pride and street rivalry.</p>

        <p>As the investigation continues, the story of DTIM_trigga’s death remains shrouded in mystery, but one thing is clear: the speculation surrounding BDC_King's involvement has left a lasting mark on the drill rap scene.</p>

        <p>Station 9 KSENT will continue to monitor the developments of this ongoing story, as law enforcement officials are still investigating the circumstances surrounding DTIM_trigga’s death. While fans of both sides mourn the loss of the rapper, the broader conversation continues to focus on the toxic cycle of violence and bravado that seems to permeate the drill scene.</p>
