        <h2>Drill Rapper BDC_King Faces Backlash After Bragging on IG Live</h2>

        <p>In a shocking turn of events, local drill rapper Zachariah, known by his stage name BDC_King, has found himself under intense scrutiny after a controversial IG Live session where he bragged about a violent act. The rapper, known for his hard-hitting drill lyrics, posted a live stream in which he claimed responsibility for a killing, while flexing about his street credibility. The live session quickly went viral, raising both eyebrows and concerns among fans, local residents, and law enforcement.</p>

        <p>In the IG Live, Zachariah boasted about his actions, seemingly unphased by the implications of his words. "Caught a body, didn’t wanna do it, but that’s the way it goes," he said, followed by a series of cryptic statements hinting at his involvement in a deadly confrontation. While he didn’t name names, the streets quickly made their own assumptions. Many speculate that the incident he alluded to may be tied to the recent death of a Demon gang member, known to be a rival to BDC.</p>

        <p>The rapper’s comment that “the gun jammed, and I still made it happen,” only fueled the rumors, as it suggested a close encounter with the law and a possibly botched attempt at self-defense. Despite his nonchalant demeanor during the IG Live, sources close to the situation confirm that law enforcement is currently investigating the rapper for potential involvement in the shooting. </p>

        <p>While some fans argue that Zachariah was simply engaging in typical drill rap bravado, others condemned his actions as a dangerous influence on youth. Authorities are reportedly watching closely as the investigation continues to unfold.</p>

        <p>For now, Station 9 will continue to follow this developing story and provide updates as they become available.</p>
